msg db obj - replyto field with msgID
if that message is the first, replyto will be 0
if that message is replying, replyto will be the msgID of what we are replying to
msg db obj - replyID with msgID of msg that is repying (update the msg obj when reply is processed)
if that message is last, replyID will have 0
if that message has a reply, replyID will be the messageID that replied
Subject will be "re: "+ original subject
update msgs if they have

IDEAS FOR DELETION HANDLING
-never delete any messages that have replies (will bog down the db)

DO NOT ALLOW MULTIPLE REPLIES TO ONE MSG

x <-> y <-> z

[msg 123 has rt=0 and rid=012 x567x] , x [msg 567 has rt=123 and rid = 012] x , [msg 012 has rt=123 x567x and rid = 0]

TODO - make msg detail page have a reply btn
-make msg detail page list replies backwards (start with this msg and follow replyto until it is 0)

Each start msg ID is also used as the convoID
Every reply folowing has that convoID
For each msg in a convo (if opened) 
	-> GET all msgs with that convoID 
	->sort by year>mo>...>sec




EVENTUALLY - when f replies mult times, chain THOSE emails together
	(1st reply to x connects to 1st msg, 
	2nd reply to x connects to f's 1st reply,
	3rd reply to x connects to f's 2nd reply,
	x's reply connects to f's last reply)
