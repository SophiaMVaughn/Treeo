AZURE
-made new account on AZURE (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
-made new mysql db server through portal (cheapest possible) by this https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/quickstart-create-mysql-server-database-using-azure-portal
	admin: treeo_master (Password1)
	server: treeo-server -- needed to change the firewall to allow all IPs to access and turn off SSL auth (portal>server menu>connection security>SSL connection disable + allow all IP [0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255])
-made new db and user (with granted access) by this https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/howto-create-users?tabs=single-server [NOTE: I have not tested how to actually use this to access the DB yet]
	user: treeoUser (Password1)
	database: treeohealthdb

in portal, the 1st option to the right of the search bar will open a bash instance in that window, then type:
	mysql --host treeo-server.mysql.database.azure.com --database treeohealthdb --user treeo_master@treeo-server -p (or treeoUser instead of treeo_master)
	
in workbench
	Home (+ to add connection)
	Name connection
	Hostname = treeo-server.mysql.database.azure.com
	Username = treeo_master@treeo-server
	Password : Password1 (in vault)
	Test connection to confirm

[NOTE: I already ran this so don't or it will drop and remake the table]
	For the setup, run mysqltest.py to insert a test row (only run 1 time)

Query in workbench to confirm (or run mysqlmessaging.py to test that it's updating the way it should)
	-sidebar doesn't have the dropdown like localhost so run this query
	
USE treeohealthdb;
