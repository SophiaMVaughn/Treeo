Messaging system notes update


	This week
	
-DynamoDB has no filter+limit (idk if this is scalable for everything we need the db to do)
	-no conditional querying
	-no inherent paging of results
1) stay with dynamo and do "dumb" workarounds that are inefficient
2) try moving to external relational database (hosting becomes an issue)
		(and we have to change all of that code)
	

Fix spacing/centering of search box/search button
##make a joinURL field on createpg AND the mtg detail page <------------------0
---DO ERROR CATCHING FOR THE USERNAME ENTERED INTO THE CREATE MEETING PAGE


#TODO -- FIX TIME ZONE MANAGEMENT (it is registering all time stamps as 4hrs in the future)
    #even the time creation is wrong but it is still seeing the time zone as EST so ??????
	#HOW TO DO WE MANAGE THE TIME XONE OF THE CREting DR VS THE TIME ZONE OF THE PATIENT???
#slider bar instead of dropdown??


	This month
#have a certain # of times the user can try logging in before being timed out
#make emails exlusive to users (??)
#profile -- Change picture (upload) 
#SOLVE LATENCY ***
	#think of ways to reduce aws queries
	-keep a list of patient on the backend (only query for it once on log in bc it won't change while the provider is logged in)
	-make query for appts better/more efficient?
	-keep list of current appts (like patients)? (how to deal with provider making an appt while patient is logged in?)
#SEND THE USER AN EMAIL (not confirmation, just notification of being added to an appt/delete and acct udated) 
	#NOT MARKED AS SPAMMMM



	Eventually
#let them delete their account
	#update messages -- from deactivated user [have deac pat and doc] [make part of the username a forbidden char so no one can make an account with that name] 
	#(don't let them reply)
Make a notification system (notify patients when a provider invites them to an appt)
##email validation? (valid domain at least)
###validation of zoom acct on creation??? Not possible
##TODO -- radio buttons for recurring meetings (how to line up recurring mtgs)
###form integration
###how to make Zoom provider sub users under the main admin acct -- are they in the secret/encrypted in the JWT key??
	#####will the same key have the ability to query all of the sub users+CRUD their meetings?
	###-- how to get the meetings that the patients have been invited to without them being owners of the JWT app/not being encrypted in the key?
#(eventually) make provider users only able to be created after approval by admins
#(eventually) validate acct (through email) - confirmation
#(eventually) forgot password/recover acct

#####TODO -- make a link in each entry to an EDITABLE/EXTENDED appt description
#####in this area, make a button for each mtg that when pushed will delet the mtg by sending /deletemtg and the mtgID
# TODO ---(make this calendar) Or when the calendar is clicked, have it call the show mtgs and format each mtg to show up correctly
#####TODO -- make a function+page that allows you to view/edit specific mtg details?

Make a seperate page for patient search(?)
Make it that when you select from the drop down it takes you to that patient's account
Make search result page (from drop down results) 
    -- works the same way as the patient list page
---------#check how the usernames are made (no spaces/unicode --> regex?) <--
---------check usernames dynamically
---------check name length dynamically
---------#make an autocomplete for patient appt create somehow (having 100+ usernames, a dropdown is not viable)
	#make a search functionality for when the provider is adding patients to the appt
	#can use binary search bc we will have it sorted
#Verify valid domain/email format
#make week/day view version of the calendar
#page out the patient print out (20/pg) 
	-> search is in relevance-order (design must be MODULAR/can be organized by anything/sent any array)

#at the top of each page put an "x-y out of z"
#make a "show pw" button on login and register and create mtg <----------
#simplify email error messages

#**make a dropdown to control the size of the page??
#MESSAGING SYSTEM -- ask isha about message info layout
#CHANGE AWS scans to queries 
**Fix drop down transparency 
	--maybe try doing the register pg approach instead?
	--maybe try a full list that updates as you type??

	
~~~~[not done -- shhhhh!]~~~~
#revise the url_for() uses in the nav bar (why is it bad??)
#now that you know how to do variable links, update how the delete and edit buttons work
#make an "add user to appt" function that updates the appt database item (max 1 patient)
#disable the create acct button if there is an error on the form? (possible???) 
	-> no need to check empty, only invalid bc we made everything required (they can't submit if something is empty)
